# Lombiq Hosting - Build Version Display for Orchard Core

[![Lombiq.Hosting.BuildVersionDisplay NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Lombiq.Hosting.BuildVersionDisplay?label=Lombiq.Hosting.BuildVersionDisplay)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.Hosting.BuildVersionDisplay/)

## About

[Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) module to display the build version (i.e. .NET assembly version or other) on the admin of the `Default` tenant. This is useful to see at a glance which version of the app you have deployed currently to the given environment. You can also display a link to the CI build's page. Watch a demo video of it from the Orchard Community Meeting [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq5UnVGw_QA).

## Documentation

Just enable the "Lombiq Hosting - Build Version Display" feature on the `Default` tenant to display the Orchard Core version and the app's .NET version on the dashboard (i.e. _/admin_).

Optionally, a link to the CI build's page can be display as well. During `dotnet build`, provide this in the `BuildVersionDisplay_BuildUrl` property. E.g.:

```pwsh
dotnet build .\MyApp.sln -p:BuildVersionDisplay_BuildUrl=https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions/actions/runs/123
```

The [Deploy to Azure App Service workflow](https://github.com/Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/blob/dev/Docs/Workflows.md#deploy-to-azure-app-service-workflow) also takes care of this.
